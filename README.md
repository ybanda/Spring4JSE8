# Concepts

- Spring Core
        Build a complete Spring MVC and Hibernate CRUD Project ... all from scratch
        Set up your Spring and Hibernate development environment with Tomcat and Eclipse
        Wire beans together in the Spring container using Inversion of Control
        Configure the Spring container for Dependency Injection
        Define Spring Beans using the @Component annotation
        Perform auto-scanning of Spring beans to minimize configuration
        Automatically wire beans together using @Autowired annotation
        Apply all Java configuration to Spring Beans (no xml)
- Spring MVC
        Set up your Spring MVC environment with configs and directories
        Create controllers using @Controller annotation
        Read HTML form data using @RequestParam
        Leverage Spring MVC model to transport data between controller and view page
        Define Request Mappings for GET and POST requests
        Minimize coding with Spring MVC Form data binding
        Apply Spring MVC form validation on user input
        Create custom Spring MVC form validation rules
- Hibernate
        Perform object/relational mapping with Hibernate
        Leverage the Hibernate API to develop CRUD apps
        Develop queries using the Hibernate Query Language (HQL)
        Integrate Spring MVC and Hibernate together in a Single Application Project
        Apply advanced Hibernate mappings: one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many
- Spring AOP
        Apply Aspect-Oriented-Programming AOP for cross-cutting concerns
        Examine AOP use-cases and how AOP can resolve code-tangling
        Create AOP pointcut expressions to match on method invocations
        Leverage AOP annotations: @Before, @After, @AfterReturning, @AfterThrowing, @Around
        Create a real-time application using AOP and Spring MVC together in a single project
- Spring Security
        Secure your web application with Spring Security
        Set up your Maven pom.xml file with compatible Spring Security dependencies
        Configure Spring Security with all Java configuration (no xml)
        Create custom Spring Security login pages with Bootstrap CSS
        Add logout support using default features of Spring Security
        Leverage Spring Security support for Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
        Define users and roles for authentication
        Display user login info and role using Spring Security tags
        Restrict access to URLs based on user role
        Hide and Display content based on user role
        Add JDBC authentication, store user accounts and passwords in the database
        Store encrypted passwords in the database using bcrypt
        Register new users and encrypt passwords using Java code.
- Maven
        Simplify your build process with Maven
        Create Maven POM files and add dependencies
        Search Central Maven repository for Dependency Coordinates
        Run Maven builds from the Eclipse IDE.
